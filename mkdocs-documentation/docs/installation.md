# Installation

## Requirements

2. **Module Upload**: The "peppol.zip" contains the module files (in a module format) that you can upload in Perfex CRM's Modules installation section.

3. **Access Module Installation**: Go to your Perfex CRM's Admin area and select: **SETUP > MODULES**.

4. **Install Module**: Select the extracted peppol.zip at Module installation selection prompt and press **INSTALL**.

5. **Activate Module**: Find the newly installed PEPPOL module and press **ACTIVATE**.

## Post-Installation Verification

After successful installation and activation:

1. Navigate to **Settings > PEPPOL Settings** to verify the module is properly installed
2. Check that the PEPPOL menu appears in the main navigation

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to the [Configuration](configuration.md) section to set up your PEPPOL provider and company information.
