# Installation

1. Extract your downloaded file content. You will notice a folder called "documentation" and a zip file, called "delivery_notes.zip". Since "documentation" folder contains this readme file and helpful instructions that are not needed in your Perfex CRM's installation, we will focus on the "delivery_notes.zip" file.

2. "delivery_notes.zip" contains the module files (in a module format) that you can upload in Perfex CRM's Modules installation section.

3. Go to your Perfex CRM's Admin area and select the following menu item: SETUP > MODULES.

4. Select the extracted delivery_notes.zip at Module installation selection prompt and press INSTALL.

5. Find the newly installed module and press ACTIVATE.
